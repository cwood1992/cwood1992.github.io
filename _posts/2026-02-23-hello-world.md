subtitle: "A place to put the things I'm thinking about."

I've been meaning to start writing for a while. Not the kind of writing you do in emails or Slack messages or budget memos — the kind where you actually have to figure out what you think about something before you say it.

This is that place.

I run operations at a commercial diving school in Houston. We train people to weld underwater and inspect pipelines and do the kind of work that keeps infrastructure from falling apart. It's a small organization with big problems, which is my favorite kind of environment to work in.

I'll be writing about whatever's on my mind — operations, marketing in vocational ed, building systems that actually get used, and the gap between knowing what to do and actually doing it. That last one is a personal specialty.

More soon.
