# Provable Lies: What the Administration Claims vs. What the Records Show

> "Choose your leaders with wisdom and forethought. To be led by a coward is to be controlled by all that the coward fears. To be led by a fool is to be led by the opportunists who control the fool. To be led by a thief is to offer up your most precious treasures to be stolen. To be led by a liar is to ask to be told lies. To be led by a tyrant is to sell yourself and those you love into slavery."

## Meet the "Worst of the Worst"

**Jerce** — A professional soccer player and coach. Husband. Father of two. He fled Venezuela due to political violence and entered the U.S. legally through the CBP One app, exactly as instructed. His asylum hearing was scheduled for April 17, 2025. He was deported to a foreign prison on March 15—one month before he could present his case. He never got his day in court. ([Human Rights Watch](https://www.hrw.org/report/2025/11/12/you-have-arrived-in-hell/torture-and-other-abuses-against-venezuelans-in-el))

**Kilmar Abrego Garcia** — A Maryland construction worker. Married to a U.S. citizen. Father of U.S. citizen children. Had a court order since 2019 specifically protecting him from deportation. No criminal record. Attended every required ICE check-in for years. Deported anyway. The Supreme Court ruled unanimously—9-0—that his deportation was unlawful. ([Supreme Court ruling](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/24a949_lkhn.pdf); [ABC News timeline](https://abcnews.go.com/US/timeline-wrongful-deportation-kilmar-abrego-garcia-el-salvador/story?id=120803843))

**The Australian wife of a U.S. Navy veteran** — No criminal history. Detained during her green card interview—the final step before becoming a permanent resident. The "crime"? A visa overstay that happened because the green card process took too long. ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/))

**George Retes** — A disabled U.S. military veteran. American citizen. Held for three days without being allowed to make a phone call. His family only found him after spotting him in a TikTok video. Despite his car displaying veteran and citizenship identifiers, agents broke his window, pepper-sprayed him, and arrested him. "They knew he was a citizen. They didn't care," Retes said. ([Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations](https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025.12.8_ICE-Report-revised-FINAL.pdf); [ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/immigration-dhs-american-citizens-arrested-detained-against-will))

These are not outliers. The Senate documented more than 170 U.S. citizens detained. Human Rights Watch interviewed 40 survivors of CECOT. The pattern is the policy.

**Renee Good** — A 37-year-old mother of three. American citizen. Shot and killed by an ICE agent in Minneapolis on January 7, 2026, while sitting in her car. She had stopped to support neighbors during an enforcement operation. The administration called her a "domestic terrorist." The video shows her smiling, hands visible, saying "I'm not mad at you" to the agent moments before he shot her. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Renee_Good); [CBC News analysis](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/ice-agent-shooting-video-minnesota-renee-good-9.7040480); [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2026/01/09/moments-before-ice-shooting-minneapolis/))

**Alex Pretti** — A 37-year-old ICU nurse. American citizen. Lawful gun owner with a permit to carry. Shot and killed by a Border Patrol agent in Minneapolis on January 24, 2026—seventeen days after Renee Good, less than a mile away. The administration claimed he "wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement." The video shows multiple agents beating him on the ground before shooting him. ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2026/01/24/nx-s1-5687276/man-shot-dead-minneapolis); [PBS NewsHour](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/police-chief-calls-for-calm-after-federal-officers-shot-and-killed-a-man-during-minneapolis-immigration-crackdown))

These are not gang members. These are workers, parents, veterans, and people who followed every rule.

## "We're targeting criminals—the worst of the worst."

**The data tells a different story.**

According to government records obtained through litigation by the [Deportation Data Project](https://deportationdata.org/):

- **74,000+ people with no criminal record** were arrested by ICE from January 20 to mid-October 2025
- People with **no criminal record** are now the **largest single group** in ICE detention
- The share of detainees with no criminal record rose from 7% under Biden to **65-70%** by late 2025

([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/12/10/nx-s1-5637397/about-a-third-of-people-arrested-by-ice-had-no-criminal-record-new-data-shows); [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/ice-arrested-nearly-75000-people-no-criminal-records-data-shows-rcna247377))

The [Marshall Project](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2025/08/15/ice-georgia-traffic-stop-arrest-immigration) found **two-thirds** of the more than 120,000 people deported had **no criminal convictions at all**. Only **12%** were convicted of violent or potentially violent crimes.

**What "criminal history" actually means in their numbers:** Traffic violations. Decade-old misdemeanors. Charges that were dismissed. Overstaying a visa (which is a civil violation, not a crime).

If traffic violations justify arrest, what justifies sending someone to a torture prison?

---

## "We're sending dangerous gang members to CECOT."

**What the administration said:**

> "DHS deported nearly 300 Tren de Aragua terrorists to CECOT Prison in El Salvador, where they no longer pose a threat to the American people."

— DHS press release, March 2025

**What Human Rights Watch documented:**

Of the 252 Venezuelans sent to CECOT ([full report](https://www.hrw.org/report/2025/11/12/you-have-arrived-in-hell/torture-and-other-abuses-against-venezuelans-in-el)):

- **48.8% had no criminal history whatsoever**—not in the U.S., not in Venezuela, not anywhere
- Only **3%** had been convicted of a violent offense in the United States
- At least **62 had pending asylum cases** and had passed their initial credible fear screening
- At least **19 had fled Venezuela specifically to escape Tren de Aragua**—the gang they were accused of belonging to

The administration's evidence of gang membership? **Tattoos and hand gestures** that looked like "rock on." In one documented case, attorneys presented a police clearance showing a clean record, an explanation of the hand gesture, and a declaration from the tattoo artist about the meaning. The man was deported anyway.

## "You Have Arrived in Hell": Inside CECOT

> "The only way you will leave is in a black bag."
>
> — Warden of CECOT prison, to arriving American deportees (Human Rights Watch, 2025)

CECOT is the largest prison in the Western Hemisphere. 40,000 inmates. Each prisoner gets **6.5 square feet of space**—smaller than a bathroom stall. Metal bunks with no mattresses. Prisoners are told they "will never leave." They're allowed out of their cells for 30 minutes per day.

Human Rights Watch [interviewed 40 survivors and 150 family members](https://www.hrw.org/report/2025/11/12/you-have-arrived-in-hell/torture-and-other-abuses-against-venezuelans-in-el). The Independent Forensic Expert Group verified injuries from photographs. What they found:

**Upon arrival:**
- Forced to kneel with heads down on the tarmac
- Heads shaved
- Beatings began immediately

**Ongoing treatment:**
- Near-daily beatings by guards in hallways and a solitary confinement area called "the Island"
- Beaten for speaking loudly, showering at the wrong time, or **requesting medical treatment**
- Rubber bullets fired "**point-blank into the cell**" when prisoners protested for basic rights
- Sexual violence
- Severe sleep deprivation and starvation
- Forced to soil themselves when denied bathroom access
- **No access to lawyers, families, or the outside world for four months**
- Threats to place them in cells with actual gang members who would kill them

One survivor, *Gonzalo Y.*, told Human Rights Watch: "The nightmare began the moment they took me off the plane." He told guards he had a spine problem and couldn't keep his head low; an officer struck him with a baton in the back of the neck.

Another man, *Martínez*, alleged he was punished for putting his head through cell bars when he felt sick. Eight guards beat him and **fractured his right arm**.

Human Rights Watch concluded these were **"not isolated incidents by rogue guards but systematic violations."** They accused the Trump administration of **complicity in torture** and **enforced disappearance**—crimes under U.S. and international law.

The U.S. government paid El Salvador at least **$6 million** to hold these prisoners.

This is not happening in secret. It is happening with U.S. funding, U.S. deportation orders, and full knowledge of where these people are being sent.

## "It Can't Happen Here"

That's El Salvador. This is Texas.

**Deaths in detention:**

- **31 people died** in immigration detention in 2025—the deadliest year in two decades. **Six more died in just the first 25 days of 2026**, putting the system on pace for 120 deaths this year. ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2026/jan/04/ice-detention-deaths-2025); [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/1/27/us-witnessed-many-ice-related-deaths-in-2026-here-are-their-stories))
- More people died in ICE detention in 2025 than in the **previous four years combined**. ICE has confirmed **36 total deaths in custody** between January 20, 2025, and January 12, 2026. ([Senator Ossoff investigation](https://www.ossoff.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/260114_Report_Patterns_v5.pdf))
- Geraldo Lunas Campos, 55, died at [Camp East Montana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_East_Montana). An eyewitness said guards choked him while he repeated **"No puedo respirar"**—"I can't breathe." The El Paso County medical examiner has **classified the death as a likely homicide**. Two more people died at the same facility within 44 days of Campos. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/09/16/ice-detention-center-immigration-violations/); [Popular Information](https://popular.info/p/in-2026-ice-detainees-are-dying-at))

![Senator Ossoff's detention oversight report documenting 1,037 credible reports of human rights abuses in immigration detention, including 36 confirmed deaths in custody. January 20, 2025 – January 12, 2026. (U.S. Senate)](/assets/images/ossoff-detention-report.png)

**Camp East Montana (Fort Bliss):**

The largest immigration detention center—2,700+ people—opened in August 2025 on the site of a WWII Japanese internment camp. A leaked [Washington Post inspection](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/09/16/ice-detention-center-immigration-violations/) found **60+ federal detention standard violations** in the first 50 days. [Human Rights Watch](https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/12/08/us-close-fort-bliss-immigration-detention-site) and the [ACLU](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/human-rights-groups-urge-ice-to-end-immigration-detention-at-fort-bliss-military-base-halt-abusive-third-country-deportations) have called for its closure, documenting:

- Sworn declarations of beatings causing hospitalization
- Sexual abuse by officers
- Threats to deport to Africa if refusing to sign documents
- One teenager testified he was beaten unconscious with his tooth broken

**ICE violence in communities:**

- The ACLU documented ICE deploying **tear gas at Roosevelt High School** and detaining a teacher
- ICE has been arresting people at **green card interviews**, **required check-ins**, and **court dates**—the very appointments the government required them to attend
- Good's killing was the [**ninth time since September 2025**](https://www.npr.org/2026/01/) that ICE agents had opened fire on people. In total, three people were shot by federal agents in Minneapolis in eighteen days—Good on January 7, Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis on January 14, and Alex Pretti on January 24

**Constitutional rights—suspended:**

On January 20, 2025, the administration rescinded the "sensitive locations" policy that had protected schools, churches, hospitals, and courthouses from immigration enforcement since 2011. The [Minnesota lawsuit](https://www.minneapolismn.gov/news/2026/january/ag-lawsuit/) documents what followed in Minneapolis: agents entering school buildings during class, conducting arrests at medical facilities where patients were receiving treatment, raiding churches and funeral homes. Schools went into lockdown. Businesses saw revenue declines of 50-80% as customers became too afraid to shop.

Then the Fourth Amendment protections fell. In September 2025, the Supreme Court ruled 6-3 in [*Noem v. Vasquez-Perdomo*](https://eji.org/news/supreme-court-allows-stops-based-on-race-to-continue/) that ICE could use "apparent ethnicity" as a factor in stops. Justice Sotomayor's dissent: the Fourth Amendment's protections may no longer apply to "those who happen to look a certain way, speak a certain way, and appear to work a certain type of legitimate job."

What that looks like in practice:

- **Mubashir Khalif Hussen**, a 20-year-old U.S. citizen, was [walking to lunch in Minneapolis](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-sues-federal-government-to-end-ice-cbps-practice-of-suspicionless-stops-warrantless-arrests-and-racial-profiling-of-minnesotans) on December 10, 2025, when masked ICE agents stopped him. He repeated "I'm a citizen. I'm a citizen." They refused to look at his ID. They shackled him, took his fingerprints, and held him for hours before releasing him.
- In **Chicago**, a federal judge [ruled in November 2025](https://stateofsurveillance.org/articles/surveillance/qualified-immunity-ice-agents-shield-accountability/) that ICE had violated the Fourth Amendment by using fake I-200 "warrants" to arrest 615 people. ICE's response: they arrested 47 more people the next day using the same method.
- **Leonardo Garcia Venegas**, a construction worker and U.S. citizen, was [detained twice](https://immigrantjustice.org/blog/congressional-hearing-on-u-s-citizens-caught-up-in-immigration-raids/) despite showing a valid REAL ID both times. He's now suing for racial profiling and constitutional violations.
- In **Los Angeles**, ICE deployed "roving patrols" to car washes, Home Depots, bus stops, farms, recycling centers, churches, and parks—arresting [nearly 2,800 people in one month](https://eji.org/news/supreme-court-allows-stops-based-on-race-to-continue/).

Border czar Tom Homan confirmed ICE stops people "based on the location, their occupation, their physical appearance, their actions like [whether] the person walks away." St. Paul's mayor said agents conduct stops based on what people "look and sound like."

The pattern: warrantless arrests, racial profiling, then qualified immunity shields the agents from accountability. A DOJ lawyer [told reporters](https://stateofsurveillance.org/articles/surveillance/qualified-immunity-ice-agents-shield-accountability/) there is "zero chance" of an immigration agent being criminally charged under this administration.

**The secret memo:**

In May 2025, ICE distributed a memo authorizing officers to forcibly enter homes using only administrative warrants—not judicial warrants signed by a judge. DHS's **own 2025 legal training manual** describes this practice as "typically a violation of the Fourth Amendment."

The memo was distributed secretly. Employees were verbally briefed and told to return their copies. Whistleblowers reported: **"It was reportedly clear that anyone who openly spoke out against this new directive would be fired."**

For 60 years, ICE required judicial warrants to enter homes. Now agents are trained to violate the Constitution—and threatened into silence if they object.

"They're just here for the immigrants, though."

---

## "No American citizens are being detained."

**DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, October 30, 2025:** "No American citizens have been arrested or detained. We focus on those who are here illegally."

![Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations report documenting more than 170 U.S. citizens detained by ICE in 2025, including minors and veterans. (U.S. Senate)](/assets/images/senate-citizens-detained-report.png)

**What the Senate documented:**

A [Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations report](https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025.12.8_ICE-Report-revised-FINAL.pdf) found **more than 170 U.S. citizens** detained by ICE in 2025, with at least 20 held more than 24 hours without access to a phone call or legal counsel.

- **Luis Hipolito**, 23, a U.S. citizen, was arrested, pepper-sprayed, and beaten so severely his face was unrecognizable
- At least **20 U.S. citizen minors** were detained, including two receiving cancer treatment
- A **10-year-old girl with brain cancer**, a U.S. citizen, was deported with her parents to Mexico while traveling to an emergency medical appointment

[ProPublica found](https://www.propublica.org/article/immigration-dhs-american-citizens-arrested-detained-against-will) 170 citizens detained, so far. Almost all Latino.

"What kind of American are you?" When the answer is "citizen" and they detain you anyway, this is their defense.

---

## "Our agents have absolute immunity."

**What Vice President Vance said** (January 8, 2026): "You have a federal law enforcement official engaging in federal law enforcement action—that's a federal issue. That guy is protected by absolute immunity. He was doing his job."

**What Stephen Miller told ICE agents** (shared by DHS after the Minneapolis shooting): "You have federal immunity in the conduct of your duties. Anybody who lays a hand on you or tries to stop you or tries to obstruct you is committing a felony."

**What the law actually says:**

Constitutional law expert Michael Mannheimer called the claim "absolutely ridiculous." Legal experts uniformly rejected it:

- "Absolute immunity" applies to judges, legislators, and prosecutors—**not law enforcement**
- The Supreme Court's [*Drury v. Lewis* (1906)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/200/1/) explicitly allowed state prosecution of federal soldiers who killed a man
- Whether a federal agent can claim immunity depends on a **fact-specific judicial inquiry** into whether their conduct was reasonable
- No government official can promise or guarantee immunity—that's for courts to decide

The administration is telling agents they're above the law. Courts have said otherwise for 120 years.

---

## "Everything we're doing is legal."

**What the Constitution actually says—per the Supreme Court:**

This isn't a contested legal question. For 140 years, the Court has held that constitutional protections apply to everyone on U.S. soil, not just citizens.

- [**Yick Wo v. Hopkins (1886)**](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/118/356/): "These provisions are universal in their application, to all persons within the territorial jurisdiction, without regard to any differences of race, of color, or of nationality."

- [**Wong Wing v. United States (1896)**](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/163/228/): "All persons within the territory of the United States are entitled to the protection" of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments—including due process and the right to a jury trial.

- [**Zadvydas v. Davis (2001)**](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/533/678/): "The Due Process Clause applies to all 'persons' within the United States, including aliens, whether their presence here is lawful, unlawful, temporary, or permanent."

**What the courts have found:**

- **Over 580 lawsuits** filed against the administration in 2025 alone ([SCOTUSblog analysis](https://www.scotusblog.com/2026/01/looking-back-at-2025-the-supreme-court-and-the-trump-administration/)). A Politico analysis found **347 judges** across the country have rejected the administration's arguments in **more than 2,400 cases**. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/))
- **More than 160 injunctions** blocked administration actions through 2025. In January 2026 alone, Minnesota's chief federal judge found ICE violated **96 court orders in 74 cases**—and called the list "almost certainly substantially understated." He wrote: **"ICE has likely violated more court orders in January 2026 than some federal agencies have violated in their entire existence."** ([Reason](https://reason.com/2026/01/29/federal-judge-slams-ice-for-violating-nearly-100-court-orders-ice-is-not-a-law-unto-itself/))
- **Every federal judge** who considered the birthright citizenship order found it unconstitutional—including Trump-appointed judges
- A judge found **"probable cause"** for criminal contempt after the administration defied a court order on deportation flights ([J.G.G. v. Trump](https://clearinghouse.net/case/46232/))
- The [Fifth Circuit ruled](https://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/25/25-10534-CV1.pdf) Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act was **"unlawful"**
- The [Supreme Court ruled **unanimously**](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/24a949_lkhn.pdf) that the Abrego Garcia deportation was unlawful
- A federal court ordered the **immediate release of all detained refugees in Minnesota** and a halt to arrests of lawfully resettled refugees under Operation PARRIS ([IRAP](https://refugeerights.org/news-resources/court-orders-ice-to-stop-unlawful-arrest-and-detention-of-refugees))

![Appendix to Judge Schiltz's order listing 96 court orders ICE violated in 74 cases in January 2026 alone — a list the judge called "almost certainly substantially understated." (U.S. District Court, District of Minnesota)](/assets/images/schiltz-96-violations-appendix.png)

On March 15, 2025, a federal judge ordered deportation flights to turn around. The administration let them continue. El Salvador's President Bukele tweeted "Oopsie...too late." Secretary of State Rubio retweeted it. ([ACLU case summary](https://www.acludc.org/cases/jgg-v-trump-challenging-unlawful-use-alien-enemies-act-1789-deport-immigrants-without-due/))

Judge Boasberg wrote: "The Constitution does not tolerate willful disobedience of judicial orders—especially by officials of a coordinate branch who have sworn an oath to uphold it."

Judges issue rulings. In Minneapolis, bystanders recorded the truth.

## Lies in Real Time

> "We know they are lying, they know they are lying, they know we know they are lying, we know they know we know they are lying, but they are still lying."
>
> — Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn

Two U.S. citizens killed in the same city. Seventeen days apart. Same agency. Same claims. Same video evidence contradicting them.

### January 7: Renee Good

**Who she was:** A 37-year-old mother of three. U.S. citizen. Shot and killed by ICE agent Jonathan Ross while sitting in her car near her home. She had stopped to support neighbors during an ICE operation.

**What the administration said:**

President Trump claimed Good "violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer" who was "recovering in the hospital." DHS Secretary Noem called it "an act of domestic terrorism." Vice President Vance called her death "a tragedy of her own making."

**What the video actually shows:**

- Good was smiling, hands visible, telling the officer **"I'm not mad at you"**
- Good turned her steering wheel **away from Ross** as she pulled forward
- Video shows Ross **stepping outward and to the side** as he fired
- [Bellingcat's video analysis](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2026/01/13/analysing-footage-of-minneapolis-ice-shooting/) found **"no visible sign in the videos"** of injuries to ICE officers
- Ross was filming with his cell phone in one hand while shooting with the other
- A [security expert told CBC](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/ice-agent-shooting-video-minnesota-renee-good-9.7040480) that "it doesn't look like anybody has hostile intent" and deadly force "was not required"

([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2026/01/09/moments-before-ice-shooting-minneapolis/); [ABC News timeline](https://abcnews.go.com/US/minneapolis-ice-shooting-minute-minute-timeline-renee-nicole/story?id=129021809); [Bellingcat](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2026/01/13/analysing-footage-of-minneapolis-ice-shooting/))

Minneapolis Mayor Frey, after watching the footage: **"Having seen the video myself, I want to tell everybody directly that is bullshit."**

After Good was shot, ICE agents left her bleeding in her car for nearly three minutes and turned away a physician who offered to help. It took more than 10 minutes before she received CPR.

A counter-fundraiser for her killer raised $375,000, with one version originally stating the shooting was "the direct result of anti-American traitors like Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey (who is Jewish)."

### January 24: Alex Pretti

**Who he was:** A 37-year-old ICU nurse. U.S. citizen. Minneapolis resident. Lawful gun owner with a permit to carry. Shot and killed by a Border Patrol agent.

**What the administration said:**

DHS claimed agents fired "defensive shots" after a man with a handgun approached them and "violently resisted" when officers tried to disarm him. DHS stated the man "wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement."

**What the video shows:**

- Multiple federal agents surrounding Pretti on the ground
- Several agents punching him while he was restrained
- An agent striking him near his head repeatedly
- Shot while being held down by multiple officers

Mayor Frey: **"I just saw a video of more than six masked agents pummelling one of our constituents and shooting him to death."**

Police Chief Brian O'Hara confirmed Pretti was "a lawful gun owner with a permit to carry."

One federal agent, walking away from protesters who called them cowards, responded: **"Boo hoo."**

([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2026/01/24/nx-s1-5687276/man-shot-dead-minneapolis); [PBS NewsHour](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/police-chief-calls-for-calm-after-federal-officers-shot-and-killed-a-man-during-minneapolis-immigration-crackdown); [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/1/24/us-federal-agents-shoot-another-person-in-minneapolis-governor); [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/))

### Blocked From Investigating

After Good's death, the DOJ blocked Minnesota state investigators from accessing evidence.

After Pretti's death, the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension secured a warrant from a judge to access the crime scene. **Federal agents blocked them anyway.**

BCA Superintendent Drew Evans: Investigators were "blocked" from gathering evidence.

Governor Tim Walz: **"This long ago stopped being a matter of immigration enforcement. It's a campaign of organized brutality against the people of our state."**

On January 14, between these two killings, federal agents shot Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis in the leg at his home. His wife filmed a Facebook Live video of her 911 call during the incident. She told the operator that agents fired through the front door. On February 3, photographic evidence of a bullet hole in the front door was presented at a court hearing, **confirming the family's account**. There were five people inside the house, including a small child, when agents fired. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2026_Minneapolis_ICE_shooting))

Three shootings in one city in eighteen days.

## When Caught Lying, Investigate the Critics

After the Minneapolis shootings, the administration's response followed a pattern: don't investigate the shooters—investigate everyone who criticized them.

**Who they won't investigate:**
- ICE agent Jonathan Ross, who killed Renee Good
- The Border Patrol agent who killed Alex Pretti

**Who they are investigating:**
- **Becca Good**—Renee's widow—for "ties to activist groups" (which is not illegal)
- **Governor Tim Walz**—for allegedly "encouraging criminals to go out on the street and impede ICE"
- **Mayor Jacob Frey**—for the same
- **Senators Elissa Slotkin and Mark Kelly**—for a video urging military members to resist "illegal orders"

Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche confirmed the investigations on Fox News.

The DOJ [blocked Minnesota state investigators from accessing evidence](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/federal-prosecutors-resign-minnesota-ice-shooting-probe-9.7044226) in the Good shooting. After the Pretti shooting, the Minnesota BCA secured a warrant from a judge to access the crime scene. Federal agents blocked them anyway.

**Oversight—eliminated:**

The machinery that might have caught any of this was dismantled.

In March 2025, the DHS Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties was gutted: **over 500 open investigations frozen**, more than 100 employees terminated. The Immigration Detention Ombudsman—the office that handled complaints from people in custody—was dissolved entirely.

Facility inspections dropped **36%** even as the detention population surged 78%. The GAO found that **31 of 33 inspected facilities failed to comply** with specific detention standards. Nearly all received passing ratings anyway.

December 2025—the month with the most detention deaths on record—was also the month with the fewest inspections.

On the same day Pretti was killed, Attorney General Pamela Bondi sent Governor Walz a letter. It demanded Minnesota repeal sanctuary policies, share Medicaid and food stamp records, and hand over **voter registration data** to the DOJ.

This is the price of peace.

## How Does This Happen?

How do federal agents beat a man on the ground and then shoot him? How does an officer film someone on his cellphone while killing her? The Minneapolis shootings weren't aberrations. They were outputs of a system engineered to produce them.

**Training gutted:**

ICE's workforce more than doubled in 2025—from approximately 10,000 to over 22,000 officers. To accommodate this, basic training was slashed from **16 weeks to 6 weeks**. Spanish language modules were eliminated. More than 200 trainees were dismissed for failing drug tests, possessing disqualifying criminal records, or failing basic fitness standards. An administration official described the situation to CNN as "a shit show."

**"Wartime recruitment":**

The recruitment strategy explicitly targets **gun rights supporters, military enthusiasts, and conservative podcast listeners**. A $100 million campaign uses geofencing technology to send ads to phones near military bases, gun shows, UFC events, and NASCAR races. The messaging calls applicants to "fulfill your mission" and perform a "sacred duty" to "defend the homeland" against "foreign invaders."

Former ICE Director Sarah Saldaña (2014-2017) warned that the speed of recruitment and "wartime" framing increases the risk of attracting people "seeking combat experience."

**What trained professionals see:**

Military veterans who observed ICE conduct in Minneapolis provided assessments. Army combat veterans Courtney Azar and Kane, who deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, reported: **"We were trained to be cool headed under pressure. They're not. ICE is not acting cool under pressure. They get angry. They punch people, they assault people."**

A 14-year National Guard veteran observing protests in Broadview, Illinois stated: **"I've seen ICE agents with fingers on their trigger, using real M16s and M9s, pointing them at people. They're just trigger happy, and there is no trigger discipline."**

These are people who showed restraint in war zones, watching ICE point rifles at families over visa violations.

You can refuse. Many did.

## The People Who Resigned Rather Than Comply

The Minneapolis shooting triggered an exodus—but it was part of a broader institutional collapse.

**In Minnesota**, six prosecutors resigned from an office of roughly 70. These weren't just any six. Joseph H. Thompson was the First Assistant U.S. Attorney, the office's second-in-command, a 12-year veteran who led the Feeding Our Future prosecution, the largest pandemic fraud case in the country. Harry Jacobs was Chief of the Criminal Division and lead prosecutor in the case against Vance Boelter, accused of assassinating Representative Melissa Hortman. Melinda Williams, a 16-year veteran and former Chief of Criminal Prosecution, secured the sex trafficking conviction of GOP operative Anton Lazzaro. The three most senior prosecutors below the U.S. Attorney, all gone. The reason: DOJ leadership demanded they investigate Renee Good's widow while refusing to investigate her killer. ([CBC News](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/federal-prosecutors-resign-minnesota-ice-shooting-probe-9.7044226); [PBS NewsHour](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/doj-prosecutors-resign-in-protest-over-handling-of-ice-shooting-investigation))

**In the Civil Rights Division**, at least six supervisors in the criminal section—the unit that normally investigates police killings—resigned after leadership refused to open an investigation. Career prosecutors had offered to drop all their other work to help. They were told no. The division has lost approximately **75% of its staff** in 2025. ([CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/minneapolis-ice-agent-shooting-justice-department-civil-rights-division-resignations/); [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/justice-department/least-3-prosecutors-resign-concerns-probe-minneapolis-ice-shooting-sou-rcna253876))

**Across the DOJ**, the scale of departure is unprecedented:

- **More than 6,400 employees** have left since January 2025
- The **Public Integrity Section**—created after Watergate to fight public corruption—has been reduced from 36 career lawyers to **two**
- More than a dozen prosecutors who worked on the Jack Smith investigations were fired; their termination letters stated they could not be "trusted" to "faithfully" implement the president's agenda

The offices designed to hold power accountable have been hollowed out. The people who built them are gone.

**The whistleblower who wouldn't lie:**

**Erez Reuveni**, formerly Acting Deputy Director of DOJ's Office of Immigration Litigation, filed a 27-page protected disclosure in June 2025. He detailed how senior officials misrepresented facts to courts and directed him to lie.

Reuveni described DOJ leadership's position toward judicial orders as literally **"fuck you"** to the courts.

In the *J.G.G. v. Trump* case—the Alien Enemies Act deportations—Reuveni alleges Deputy AAG Ensign falsely told the court he didn't know about removal flights "in the next 24 or 48 hours." Emil Bove allegedly advised DHS it could deplane individuals despite the court's oral injunction because the written order hadn't yet issued.

When Reuveni repeatedly requested that DHS disseminate guidance on complying with injunctions, leadership refused. A senior counselor told him: "My take on these emails is that DOJ leadership and DOJ litigators don't agree on the strategy. Please keep DHS out of it."

Reuveni refused to sign an appeal brief containing unsupported arguments. He was terminated April 11, 2025.

They could walk away. Others can not.

## Aftermath

**Jerce Reyes Barrios** — The Venezuelan soccer coach was released from CECOT in July 2025 as part of a prisoner swap. He was returned to Venezuela—the country he fled for protesting the Maduro regime. His asylum hearing had been scheduled for April 17, 2025. He never got to present his case. He was never charged with any crime. ([ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/US/dreaming-soccer-coach-deported-tattoo-celebrates-release-cecot/story?id=124075548))

![First page of the Supreme Court's unanimous ruling in the Abrego Garcia case — all nine justices, including Trump appointees, found the deportation unlawful. (Supreme Court of the United States)](/assets/images/scotus-abrego-garcia-ruling.png)

**Kilmar Abrego Garcia** — After spending months in CECOT, being returned to face federal human smuggling charges (which he denies), being detained again, and being released again, Abrego Garcia is home in Maryland with his American wife and children. In a [31-page opinion](https://wearecasa.org/judge-orders-kilmar-abrego-garcia-released-from-immigration-detention/), Judge Xinis found the government held him **without a valid removal order**—the basic legal document required to deport anyone. The government produced two witnesses at separate hearings; both candidly admitted they had never seen a removal order for Abrego Garcia. Judge Xinis also found the government **misled the court** about Costa Rica's willingness to accept him as a refugee. His January 2026 criminal trial was postponed due to a backlog of motions, including whether the [prosecution is vindictive](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/abrego-garcia-prosecution-push-began-after-wrongful-deportation-court-order/). The government attempted deportation to four African countries—Uganda, Eswatini, Ghana, and Liberia—all nations where Abrego Garcia has no ties and does not speak the language. The first three publicly refused. He remains willing to go to Costa Rica; the government refuses. A ruling on whether he can be re-detained was expected by February 12. Two other men wrongfully deported to El Salvador in similar fashion have **not been returned**. ([Lawfare](https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/the-situation--one-judicial-opinion-that-sums-up-everything); [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2026/02/03/g-s1-108426/trump-kilmar-abrego-garcia-immigration-mistaken-deportations))

**The Australian wife of the Navy veteran** — Released on bond after eight days in detention. She is still pursuing her green card. The government never disputed that her marriage was real or that she qualified for legal status. "You've got to wonder what eight days of detention served," her attorney said. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ice-arrests-san-diego-green-card-interviews-include-military-spouses-rcna246851))

**George Retes** — The disabled Army veteran is suing the federal government for unconstitutional detention. He testified before Congress in December 2025, telling lawmakers: "I have all the proof to prove I'm a citizen. My license plate is disabled veteran. I have a sticker on my windshield that says Iraq combat veteran. My ID says veteran on it. They didn't care." DHS claimed he "became violent"—a claim Retes denies and that follows a pattern the Senate found of ICE falsely accusing detained citizens of assault. He missed his daughter's third birthday while held without charges. ([Senate report](https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025.12.8_ICE-Report-revised-FINAL.pdf))

**Renee Good** — The mother of three was buried after a memorial attended by thousands. A one-month memorial on February 7 drew hundreds more; dozens were arrested outside the federal building during protests that followed. An independent autopsy commissioned by her family found she was **shot in the head**. A fundraiser for her family raised over $1.5 million. Governor Walz proclaimed January 9, 2026, "Renee Good Day." The FBI has formally told Minnesota's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension it will **solely lead the inquiry**, excluding state investigators—despite Minnesota's extensive experience investigating officer-involved shootings. Minnesota prosecutors set a February 17 deadline for the federal government to turn over evidence. Federal authorities have not disclosed whether agent Jonathan Ross remains on duty. The DOJ's Civil Rights Division has **not opened an investigation** into her death. ([Military.com](https://www.military.com/daily-news/headlines/2026/02/10/Remember-Renee-Partner-Speaks-as-ICE-Shooting-Fuels-National-Outcry.html); [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2026/01/14/nx-s1-5676324/minnesota-ice-shooting-investigation-fbi-renee-macklin-good); [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/renee-good-was-shot-head-autopsy-commissioned-family-finds-rcna255335))

**Alex Pretti** — The ICU nurse was buried after a memorial in Minneapolis. A fundraiser for his family raised over $1 million within 24 hours. His parents rejected the administration's claims, calling them "sickening lies." His father said Alex "cared about people deeply and he was very upset with what was happening in Minneapolis... He knew it was wrong, so he did participate in protests." Unlike in Good's case, the DOJ's Civil Rights Division **has opened an investigation** into Pretti's death—though no charging decisions or timeline have been announced. ([NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/alex-pretti-fatally-shot-federal-officers-minneapolis-identified-paren-rcna255758); [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2026/02/12/nx-s1-5712280/minnesota-ice-surge-ends))

The worst of the worst.

## The Record

Half the people sent to a foreign torture prison had no criminal record. Many were asylum seekers who fled the very gang they were accused of joining. They were forcibly disappeared for four months, denied any contact with lawyers or family, systematically beaten—and the U.S. government paid for it.

Here at home, U.S. citizens are being detained, beaten, and held without access to lawyers—despite official denials. People are being arrested at the appointments the government required them to attend. Two U.S. citizens were shot dead in Minneapolis in seventeen days—and when video contradicted the administration's account both times, the DOJ investigated the widow, the governor, and the mayor who criticized the shootings, while refusing to investigate the agent who killed Renee Good. Agents fired through a family's front door with a child inside. An independent autopsy found Good was shot in the head.

When career prosecutors refused to participate, they resigned or were forced out. The Public Integrity Section—created after Watergate—has been reduced to two lawyers. The Civil Rights Division has lost three-quarters of its staff.

At least 37 people have died in detention since January 2025—including one death ruled a likely homicide, where a man choked out by guards repeated "I can't breathe." Six more died in the first 25 days of 2026 alone. Courts have ruled the administration's actions unconstitutional or unlawful more than 160 times in 2025. In January 2026, ICE violated at least 96 additional court orders in a single federal district—Minnesota—prompting the chief judge to write that "ICE has likely violated more court orders in January 2026 than some federal agencies have violated in their entire existence." Across the country, 347 judges have rejected the administration's legal arguments in more than 2,400 cases. The Supreme Court ruled unanimously that at least one deportation was illegal. The Fifth Circuit found the administration's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act "unlawful."

The administration lies, and the lies are provable. They said Renee Good ran over an agent who was hospitalized. The video shows her steering away from him as he stepped aside and shot her. They said Alex Pretti wanted to "massacre law enforcement." The video shows six agents beating him on the ground before shooting him. They said no citizens were detained. The Senate documented more than 170. They said the Minneapolis operation targeted dangerous criminals. Of those arrested, only 5% had records of violent crimes. Only 23 of the 3,000+ arrestees were Somali, despite the operation being framed around Somali community fraud.

On February 12, 2026, Tom Homan announced that Operation Metro Surge was ending. More than 4,000 people had been arrested. Two U.S. citizens were dead. Minnesota's attorney general noted that two of the three homicides committed in Minneapolis in 2026 came at the hands of federal immigration agents. Polls showed Trump's approval on immigration had cratered to 39%. Governor Walz called it an occupation that left "generational trauma." Mayor Frey said: "They thought they could break us, but a love for our neighbors and a resolve to endure can outlast an occupation."

These are documented facts from court rulings, government data, and verified investigations. The records exist. The question is what we do with them.
