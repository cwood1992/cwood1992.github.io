I run a commercial diving school in Houston. I also build things, automate things, and think too much about the distance between knowing what to do and actually doing it.

Most of my work is operations — the kind where you're holding together a small organization with duct tape, spreadsheets, and whatever system you built last month. Some of it is marketing, compliance, finance, or whatever else needs doing on a given Tuesday.

Outside of work, I'm usually making something or taking something apart. CNC, drones, code, AI tools, the occasional soap recipe. I'm a better starter than finisher, which is something I'm working on.

This site is where I put the stuff I'm thinking about. Some of it will be useful. Some of it is just me figuring things out in public.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/cwood1992) or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com).
